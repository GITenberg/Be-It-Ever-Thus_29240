<p class="pr1"><big><b>The planet's natives were so similar to their conquerors that no
one could tell them apart&mdash;except for their difference in thinking.</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">This was</span> Graduation Day. The
senior class from the Star Institute
of Advanced Science was
scheduled to go through the
Museum of the Conquered and
observe the remnants of the race
that had once ruled this planet.
There were many such museums
maintained for the purpose of allowing
the people to see the greatness
their ancestors had displayed
in conquering this world and also
to demonstrate how thorough and
how complete that conquest had
been. Perhaps the museums had
other reasons for existing, but
the authorities did not reveal
these reasons. Visiting such a
museum was part of the exercises
of every graduating class.</p>

<p>Billy Kasker arrived early, to
take care of all last minute problems
for Mr. Phipper, the instructor
who would take the group
through the museum, and to make
certain that all of the members of
the graduating class knew what
they were supposed to do on the
trip. Billy Kasker was class president.
A handsome, husky youth,
accommodating, generous, and
thoughtful to a fault. He was well
liked both by the faculty and the
students. He was pleasant to
everybody, even to Joe Buckner,
who called him "teacher's pet"
and sneeringly remarked that he
had been elected class president
as a result of a superb job of
boot-licking.</p>

<p>Even such remarks as these
had not disturbed Bill Kasker. He
still acted as if Joe Buckner was
his best friend.</p>

<p>"Are we all here, Billy?" the
instructor called.</p>

<p>"All here, sir," Billy Kasker
answered.</p>

<p>"Very well. Let's start to the
museum. As we go through you
may ask any questions you wish.
However, I must insist you stay
close to me and not wander from
the group. We will be in no
danger, you understand&mdash;the
creatures living in the museum
have had their fangs pulled most
effectively&mdash;but even so we must
not take chances."</p>

<p>The instructor led off. He was
a fussy little person in a shiny
black coat and a soft hat that
was too big for him. No matter
how much paper he stuffed inside
the brim, the hat never seemed to
fit right. Peering through glasses
that were always threatening to
fall off, he moved away from the
Star Institute toward the nearby
museum. The class of eight girls
and nine boys followed him.</p>

<p>"Why do we have to go through
this old museum?" Joe Buckner
complained. "We already know
everything about it."</p>

<p>"It's the rule," Billy Kasker
answered. "The faculty thinks we
should see the situation at first
hand. Then we will have a better
understanding of it."</p>

<p>Joe Buckner grunted disdainfully.
"You're always sucking in
with the big shots and telling
everybody what they say."</p>

<p>"You asked me. I tried to tell
you." Billy Kasker's voice was
still pleasant. If a slight glint appeared
in his eyes, it remained
there for only a second.</p>

<p>The museum was an open area
many miles long. It was enclosed
by a high, electrically charged
fence along which guard towers
were placed at regular intervals.
There was only one gate, to which
the instructor led the class. A
captain, resplendent in a brilliant
uniform, came out of the guard
house to greet them.</p>

<p>"The graduating class from the
Star Institute, eh? Good. We had
notice that you were coming.
Guard, bring Mr. Phipper a <i>Thor</i>
gun, then open the gates." The
last was spoken in a brisk tone
to the guard who had followed the
captain.</p>

<p>The <i>Thor</i> gun was brought immediately.
It was a small weapon,
with a belt and holster. The
captain took it from the holster.
Watching, Billy Kasker had the
impression that the weapon was
made of glittering, spun glass. It
had a short, heavy barrel in which
tiny instruments were visible. Billy
Kasker watched very closely.</p>

<p>"Do you know how to use it?"
the captain asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," the instructor
answered.</p>

<p>"Is it so dangerous in there
that we need a <i>Thor</i> gun?" Susan
Sidwell said. Susan had majored
in ionic chemistry and had
graduated with high honors.</p>

<p>"No, it isn't dangerous at all,"
the instructor answered hastily.
"The weapon is worn merely for
the sake of tradition."</p>

<p>"No danger at all, young lady,"
the captain said. "Nothing to
worry about. Not while you've
got this, anyhow." He patted the
<i>Thor</i> gun which the instructor
was buckling to his waist.</p>

<p>The gates were open. The instructor
in the lead, the group
passed through. Billy Kasker
brought up the rear. Joe Buckner
was directly ahead of him.</p>

<p>They went first to see the
wreckage of the city&mdash;shattered
walls, tumbled buildings, streets
with rubble still piled in them.
Weeds and creeping vines grew
over the broken bones of this city
as if they were attempting to hide
the ugly scars.</p>

<p>The instructor adjusted his
voice to the proper tone. He
had made this same speech to
many graduating classes and he
knew exactly what he was going
to say.</p>

<p>"You understand, of course,
that this part of the old city was
almost completely destroyed in
our attack of the year 4021 After
Yevbro, or the year 1967, according
to the way the natives
reckoned time on this planet. This
part of it has been allowed to
remain the way our ships left it,
as an example of the effectiveness
of our weapons."</p>

<p>His voice gave the impression
that he was personally participating
in that attack and was enjoying
the destruction that had taken
place. He stood straight, squared
his shoulders and breathed
deeply.</p>

<p>"What happened to the natives
who lived here?" Billy Kasker
asked.</p>

<p>The instructor frowned. "Oh,
they were killed." At first he was
a little irritated at the question,
then again satisfaction came back
into his voice.</p>

<p>"They got what was coming to
them for trying to resist our sky
ships," Joe Buckner said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they deserved their
fate." The instructor hitched the
<i>Thor</i> gun a little higher on his
hip.</p>

<p>Billy Kasker was silent.</p>

<p>"We will go next to the fields,
then to the factory section&mdash;such
of as there is&mdash;then to that part
of the city which we have allowed
the natives to rebuild. Come."</p>

<p>The class moved out of the
city. Here they saw their first
natives. Clad mostly in rags&mdash;many
of them bent and stooped,
some of them showing the marks
of hunger&mdash;they were a quiet
people who kept strictly out of
the way of the class group. But
except for the clothing and the
marks of hunger, they were identical
in appearance with their conquerors.</p>

<p>"Why, they look just like us!"
Joe Buckner said indignantly. He
sounded outraged at the resemblance.</p>

<p>"There are many differences,"
the instructor said quickly. "Note
their clothing, how poorly made
it is. They make it themselves out
of the wool of some kind of
animal&mdash;deer, I believe, or bear."</p>

<p>"Sheep," Billy Kasker corrected.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sheep is the name of
the animal. Thank you, Billy."</p>

<p>"You're welcome, sir."</p>

<p>"But they oughtn't to look like
<i>us</i>!" Joe Buckner continued.</p>

<p>"There are chemical differences,"
Susan Sidwell said.
"Once, in the laboratory, we
analyzed their blood. The color
was different for one thing. They
also have a much different metabolism."</p>

<p>"But suppose one of them
escaped from the museum and got
into our part of the world. How
would we know he wasn't one of
us, if he put on our clothes?" Joe
Buckner sounded outraged.</p>

<p>"That is one purpose our
bracelets serve," the instructor
answered. "A very good question,
Joe. As you know, each of us
receives a bracelet at birth, which
is slipped over the hand and onto
the wrist. Made of <i>plasticum</i>,
which cannot be cut by any
method, the bracelet has the
unique property of expanding in
size as the wearer grows. It cannot
be removed except by cutting off
the arm of the wearer." He
laughed as if he had made a good
joke. "But I am sure no one
would ever think of doing that.
The bracelet carries the serial
number assigned to each of us."</p>

<p>He held up his arm, exhibiting
the gleaming circle of <i>plasticum</i>
on his wrist. To him&mdash;to all of
them&mdash;it was a badge of honor,
a mark that proved one belonged
to a superior race. "If one of the
natives escaped, the absence of a
bracelet would disclose his identity
at once. We would take measures
to have him eliminated."</p>

<p>"I see," Joe Buckner said. He
sounded mollified. "How would
we eliminate him?"</p>

<p>"I believe it is customary to
use a <i>Thor</i> gun in such cases&mdash;a
large caliber which will disintegrate
him instantly. The model I
have will only blast a hole a few
inches in diameter."</p>

<p>"I'm going to be a <i>Thorgunman</i>,"
Joe Buckner said with sudden
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Good!" the instructor said.
"That is a very fine calling. If I
had my life to live over again&mdash;"
He sighed for lost opportunities.</p>

<p>At the announcement of his
ambition, Joe Buckner rose higher
in the opinion of the class.</p>

<p>"Observe how they make their
living," the instructor continued.</p>

<p>The class saw the natives at
work tilling the soil. The technique
used here was very crude but
mildly interesting. They used
plows and harrows for loosening
the soil, devices that were pulled
by large animals.</p>

<p>"<i>Horses</i>, I believe they call the
animals. Of course, we don't
allow them to have power-drawn
equipment."</p>

<p>"It's not at all like the way we
obtain our food," Billy Kasker
said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," the instructor
answered. "We synthesize our
foods. As a matter of fact, they
are <i>required</i> to grow their food.
That way, they have to spend so
much time finding something to
eat that they can't cause trouble."
He grinned as if something in the
idea pleased him.</p>

<p>"Serves them right," Joe Buckner
said.</p>

<p>The natives working in the
fields seemed not to see the class.
When the group came near, they
stopped talking and worked
harder.</p>

<p>"Scared to talk when we're
around," Joe Buckner said.
"They're yellow!"</p>

<p>"Now for the factory section,"
the instructor said.</p>

<p>The factories were small and
unimpressive. Working here with
very crude tools and with no
power equipment, the natives
were making farm machinery.</p>

<p>"Why don't we give them better
tools?" Billy Kasker asked.</p>

<p>"What have they got coming?"
Joe Buckner exclaimed. "They
lost, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you had your way you'd be
sucking in and helping the side
that lost. Pretty soon you'd discover
<i>you</i> had lost!"</p>

<p>"Hardly that," Billy Kasker replied.
"But it seems more human&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Human?</i> That's a laugh!" Joe
Buckner slapped his thighs and
roared with laughter.</p>

<p>"Come along," the instructor
said.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;there are children
playing games!" Susan Sidwell
observed. "Horrible-looking little
brats, aren't they?" She pointed
to a group of brown-skinned
youngsters playing some kind of
a game that involved a ball and a
club. One threw the ball, the
second struck at it with the club.</p>

<p>"What a stupid way to play,"
Joe Buckner said.</p>

<hr />

<p>As soon as the young natives
saw the graduating group coming,
they stopped their game and ran
away. They seemed very
frightened.</p>

<p>"The young ones fear us," the
instructor explained. "The older
ones fear us too, but they don't
show it so much." He watched
the fleeing youngsters with every
evidence of great inward satisfaction.</p>

<p>Billy Kasker's lips closed in a
thin straight line.</p>

<p>"Now we will go to the rebuilt
section."</p>

<p>They walked on.</p>

<p>"One of the natives is following
us," Susan Sidwell suddenly
said.</p>

<p>Turning, the group saw that a
member of the conquered race
was coming along the street behind
them. He was dressed all in
brown&mdash;his hat, his shirt, his
pants.</p>

<p>The instructor put his hand on
the butt of the <i>Thor</i> gun.</p>

<p>The native walked past the
group without seeming to see it.
He was whistling between his
teeth. He walked on ahead of
them, turned down an alley, and
disappeared. The instructor took
his hand off the <i>Thor</i> gun.</p>

<p>"He wasn't really following us;
he wouldn't dare. Does anybody
have any questions?" He looked
brightly around the group.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," Joe Buckner
said. "Why don't we just kill all
of these natives? They're not any
good to us."</p>

<p>The instructor smiled slyly.
"I'll tell you a little secret about
that. It's awfully hard to kill <i>all</i>
of any race. No matter how
thoroughly you do the job, a few
always manage to escape. Then
they breed and increase in spite
of everything you do.</p>

<p>"After we had conquered this
planet we had trouble catching all
of the natives. They were the
most cantankerous, persistent
race you can imagine. So these
museums were set up, to lure
them in here. We announced that
these places would be set aside
and that they would not be
bothered as long as they remained
in the museums. All in all, we
made the museums rather attractive
places, hoping that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see the plan!" Joe Buckner
said glowingly. "After you got
them all into the museums&mdash;<i>blooie!</i>&mdash;knock
all of them off at
once!"</p>

<p>The instructor smiled. He
looked as pleased as if he had
thought of the idea himself. A
little stir of applause ran through
the group as they expressed their
gratitude to their rulers for making
this world safe for them.</p>

<p>"Why haven't they been killed
before now?" Billy Kasker asked.
"These museums were opened
over forty years ago. Surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," the
instructor answered. "I think
probably our rulers are waiting
for a propitious time, or perhaps
for an incident that will give them
an excuse to carry out their plan."</p>

<p>"I hope they don't wait too
long," Joe Buckner said. "Golly,
I want to be a <i>Thorgunner</i> and
get in on the mop-up when it
comes!"</p>

<p>The group stirred, seemed to
look forward to the day of the
final slaughter.</p>

<p>"Any other questions?" the instructor
asked.</p>

<p>"I have one," Billy Kasker
said hesitantly. "It doesn't exactly
have anything to do with
our trip through the museum&mdash;it's
something I ran across in a book&mdash;but
I don't quite understand it,
and I wondered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go right ahead, Billy. What
do you have on your mind?"</p>

<p>"Well, ah, did&mdash;did you ever
hear of a <i>changeling</i>? I know it's
a kind of a silly question but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A <i>changeling</i>?" The instructor
frowned.</p>

<p>"I think it comes out of a fairy
story or something like that,"
Billy Kasker said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Now I recall the
word." The instructor's face
lighted. "It's a story about the
fairies taking one child from its
crib and substituting another for
it. The substituted child was
called a <i>changeling</i>. Or perhaps
some poor mother, wishing to
give her child a better chance,
stole the child of a rich mother
and put her child in its place. I
really don't remember too much
about it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. You have
explained it very lucidly."</p>

<p>The instructor beamed.</p>

<p>Joe Buckner sniffed. "Asking
a question, then telling the instructor
he has explained it very
clearly when you didn't even ask
a sensible question in the first
place&mdash;that's what I call sucking
in! Who ever heard of a <i>changeling</i>?"</p>

<p>The group moved on. They
came to the section of the city
that had been repaired. The
streets had been cleared of the
rubble, houses had been rebuilt,
and here and there little touches
of green grass showed where an
attempt to add a touch of beauty
had been made.</p>

<p>They saw very few of the
natives. Far ahead of them they
occasionally glimpsed a native
slipping furtively out of the way.
Behind them, always at a distance,
heads occasionally poked around
corners at them.</p>

<p>"They're very cowardly," the
instructor said.</p>

<p>"Where's Billy Kasker?" Susan
Sidwell suddenly asked.</p>

<p>The group halted. Billy Kasker
was no longer following them. A
little stir of consternation ran
through them as they realized the
class president was missing.</p>

<p>"Billy! Billy!" the instructor
called.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"I just don't understand this.
He knows he should remain with
us."</p>

<p>"Maybe some of these horrible
natives grabbed him!" Susan Sidwell
said. The group was startled&mdash;and
suddenly afraid.</p>

<hr />

<p>The instructor took a deep
breath. "I have a <i>Thor</i> gun. I'll
go find him. Joe, you are in
charge of the group until I return.
All of you remain in the middle of
the street and don't move."</p>

<p>The instructor went back along
the street. He was exasperated
and a little alarmed. If anything
happened to Billy, how could he
explain the matter to the gate
captain or to Billy's parents?</p>

<p>"Billy!" he called again and
again.</p>

<p>Suddenly he had an answer
from an alley.</p>

<p>"Here, sir&mdash;here I am. Are
you looking for me? I'm sorry,
sir." Billy himself appeared in the
alley.</p>

<p>Reassured at the sight of the
youth, but angry, the instructor
moved into the alley. "What is
the meaning of this? You have
alarmed all of us."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, sir. But I
saw something back here that
interested me, and I stopped to
take a look. I hope you will forgive
me." His manner was so
contrite and his chagrin so complete
that the instructor had no
choice but to forgive him.</p>

<p>"Of course, Billy. But you
mustn't do anything like this
again. It might be dangerous."</p>

<p>"I won't, sir. I promise. But I
wonder, since you are here, if you
would be good enough to explain
to me the thing I saw back here.
It will only take a minute."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's something in one of the
houses. I came back looking at
something else, then caught a
glimpse of this. If you will come
into the back yard you can see it.
I would really like to have you
explain it to me, sir. You are
always so clear in your explanations."
Billy Kasker's manner was
very winning.</p>

<p>"Well, if it will only take a
minute&mdash;" The instructor followed
Billy into the back yard. At the
rear was a shed with an open
window. A plot of grass separated
the shed from the house. On the
second floor of the house, a
window had been shattered.</p>

<p>"There's something up there in
that broken window. If you will
come here, sir, you can see it
better."</p>

<p>"Um. Ah! Oh, yes." The instructor's
back was to the open
window of the shed. He stared
upward at the house.</p>

<p>Two brown-coated arms came
out of the window of the shed and
clamped a fierce grip around his
throat, jerking him backward
against the wall. He grabbed frantically
for the <i>Thor</i> gun.</p>

<p>The face of the brown native
appeared in the window of the
shed. "Get that gun, Billy!"</p>

<p>Billy Kasker was already in
action. He snatched the gun from
the instructor's flailing hands.</p>

<p>The brown native leaned from
the window. Muscles bulging in
his powerful arms, he lifted the
instructor upward and through the
window. A thump came from inside
the shed. Billy Kasker, <i>Thor</i>
gun ready for use, went through
the door.</p>

<p>The instructor was writhing on
the floor. The native had a knee
on his chest, a knife in his hand.</p>

<p>"This is for the race you <i>think</i>
you've conquered!" the native
said. He plunged the knife into
the instructor's throat. Green
liquid spurted from the wound.</p>

<p>"Green blood!" the native said.
"One of the chemical differences."
He came to his feet. The dying
instructor was forgotten. The
native's hand went out. "Billy,
am I glad to see you. I was afraid
you wouldn't recognize me in
spite of the tune I was whistling
as I walked past you on the
street."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't forget," Billy
Kasker said.</p>

<p>"But, Billy, it's been twelve
years since I traded you, as a kid
of five, for one of their brats&mdash;changing
the bracelet as I changed
you. Many times since then I've
thought you had forgotten, or that
I wouldn't live to see the day
when you came back here with a
graduating class."</p>

<p>"I don't forget," Billy Kasker
said. "I'm even class president!"
The words burst out of him as if
he was still having trouble understanding
what they meant.</p>

<p>"That's wonderful, Billy. You're
accepted as one of them, but
you're one of us all the time.
You're in with them, you're set.
You have done a wonderful job
and I'm proud of you."</p>

<p>The glow in the native's eyes
was a wonderful sight to behold.
In it there showed the hope of the
future for all the conquered
natives of this lost planet that had
once been called Earth&mdash;the faith,
the sure knowledge that they
would rise again ... indeed, that
they were already rising.</p>

<p>"Thank you! But&mdash;" Billy
nodded toward the body of the
instructor, then spun hastily as a
sound came from the rear of the
shed, the <i>Thor</i> gun coming to
focus. A trap door was rising
there. Three natives were looking
up from under it.</p>

<p>"They're all right," the brown
native said quickly. "They're
with us."</p>

<p>Three ragged men scrambled
up from below. They looked at
the brown native, then at the body
of the instructor on the floor. A
look of fierce exultation appeared
on their faces. Then they looked
at Billy Kasker and at the <i>Thor</i>
gun he was holding.</p>

<p>"Give the <i>Thor</i> gun to Jim,"
the brown native said.</p>

<p>Without hesitation Billy Kasker
handed the gun to the native who
reached for it. Jim did everything
but kiss the weapon. "God, the
years I've spent dreaming of the
moment when I would get one of
these babies into my hands! One
was all I needed."</p>

<p>"Don't stand there gloating, Jim&mdash;get
moving," the brown native
said. "Within a month I want you
not only to know how a <i>Thor</i> gun
works but to be manufacturing
them by the dozens, including the
large sizes. This is the gun that
has been stopping us all these
years&mdash;it is the gun that is going
to take us out of these pig pens
they call museums. Get moving!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Jim was already
gone through the trap door.</p>

<hr />

<p>The brown native jerked off the
instructor's clothes, then worked
quickly but deftly with his knife.
As he finished, the instructor's
hand separated from the arm at
the wrist.</p>

<p>"He said no one would ever
<i>think</i> of doing anything like that,"
Billy Kasker said.</p>

<p>"Nobody but one of us stinking
natives." The brown man
removed the <i>plasticum</i> bracelet,
began to work with the fingers of
his left hand. "I've spent years
learning how to throw my thumb
out of joint, just getting ready for
the time&mdash;"</p>

<p>The <i>plasticum</i> bracelet slipped
over the collapsed thumb. It fitted
very snugly on his wrist. He held
it up.</p>

<p>"Neat, eh. This makes me one
of the conquerors."</p>

<p>"A nice fit. But we have very
little time. The group will become
alarmed."</p>

<p>The second native began to
take the instructor's body down
the trap door. The brown native
swiftly slipped off his clothes and
donned the garments the instructor
had worn.</p>

<p>"Ed, where's that <i>Thor</i> gun
model? I've got to have something
that looks and feels like a
genuine <i>Thor</i> gun to turn in at
the gate."</p>

<p>"Here it is, sir." The third
native handed a gleaming replica
of the <i>Thor</i> gun to the brown
man. He slipped it into the
holster. It fitted snugly.</p>

<p>"How do I look, Billy?"</p>

<p>Billy Kasker surveyed the
brown native. He was remarkably
changed. No longer did he look
like one of the natives, he looked
like a conqueror. "Just a little
higher on the nose with the
glasses. And maybe a little less
stuffing inside the brim of the
hat. But&mdash;can you carry off the
part of the instructor?"</p>

<p>"I can carry it off or die trying,"
the brown native said.</p>

<p>"Good!" The two shook hands,
then turned and went out the
door. As they left, Billy Kasker
saw that Ed was mopping the last
remnants of the green blood from
the floor.</p>

<p>"Perfect, down to the last detail,"
Billy Kasker said. "You're
a genius at planning."</p>

<p>"You have to be a genius to
stay alive. Okay, Billy. Here is
where we go into our act."</p>

<p>They had moved into the street
and the group had seen them. The
voice that came from the brown
native's mouth was the voice of
the instructor, hot and angry.</p>

<p>"Billy, this sort of conduct is
intolerable. You know better than
to wander off like this. What possible
explanation can you offer
for your conduct?"</p>

<p>Billy Kasker was very penitent.
He was embarrassed, he was humiliated,
and he showed both
very clearly. He had lost all of
his air of easy aplomb. "I'm very
sorry, sir. I didn't think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's just it, you didn't think.
You saw nothing in that alley, yet
you asked me to come back and
look. Is that the way you waste
your and my time?"</p>

<p>"It won't happen again, sir,"
Billy Kasker said contritely.</p>

<p>"See that it doesn't."</p>

<p>"Yah!" Joe Buckner gloated.
"This is one time the class president
got it in the neck!"</p>

<p>"A very good point you have
brought out," the instructor said.
"Billy has just demonstrated his
unfitness to be class president. I
am therefore removing him from
this position and appointing you
in his stead."</p>

<p>"What?" Joe Buckner gasped,
giddy with pleasure.</p>

<p>Billy Kasker took his position
in line. No longer did he bring
up the rear. Joe Buckner now
had that position of honor. The
group showed some sympathy for
Billy, but not very much or very
long. When he lost his position
as president they seemed to
change their minds about him.</p>

<p>The group moved slowly
through the city. As if nothing
had happened, the instructor explained
what they were seeing.
When they asked questions, he
answered them. Billy Kasker
asked no more questions.</p>

<p>They finally came to the gate
and the same resplendent captain
greeted them. He accepted the
<i>Thor</i> gun and the holster, handed
them to the guard.</p>

<p>"How are things in the
museum?"</p>

<p>"Everything is in good order,
sir."</p>

<p>"Good. I've had the impression
they were getting a little
restless lately."</p>

<p>"I saw no signs of it."</p>

<p>"Fine. Did you have any
trouble with the group?"</p>

<p>"Very little. Billy Kasker wandered
off for a few moments and
I had to demote him. But it was
nothing. See you next year when
I bring another graduating class
through to show them around."</p>

<p>The group began to separate to
go to their own homes. Billy Kasker
lingered a little, to speak to
the instructor. "I've already asked
my folks, sir, so I know it will
be all right with them, so if you
would like to come home with
me tonight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hmmmm."</p>

<p>"Trying to suck in again," Joe
Buckner said. "It won't do you
any good now. You're cooked for
good this time!"</p>

<p>Billy Kasker seemed not to hear
him. His eyes were on the instructor.
"We would be very glad
to have you, sir. We could talk
about a great many things."</p>

<p>"Why, Billy, in that case I will
be glad to come home with you."</p>

<p>They moved away together.
"There's one thing I want made
completely clear," Billy Kasker
said.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"When the time comes, there is
one conqueror I've got on <i>my</i>
list!"</p>

<p>"That jerk I made class president?
Of course, Billy. We will
be glad to save him for you
alone." The instructor's smile
was a happy one.</p>

<p>"Good. That's agreed then."
In the gathering dusk, Billy Kasker's
voice was as sharp as the
edge of a knife driving home into
a throat from which green blood
spurted....</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
